# microservices

Wanting to learn more about microservices, I've followed the tutorial [How to create a Microservice application with spring boot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh1oQHXVSc0&list=PLSVW22jAG8pBnhAdq9S8BpLnZ0_jVBj0c&ab_channel=ProgrammingTechie) in order to build this small project. 

This project taught me a lot about different technologies and how microservices communicate with each others. I learned how to create an API Gateway and a service discovery with Spring Cloud. I also discovered Kafka to configure an Event Driven Architecture.

For security, it's using the Oauth2 protocol with Keycloak.
